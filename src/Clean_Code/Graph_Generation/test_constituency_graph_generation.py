Test Constituency Graph Generation

This script tests the graph generation process specifically for constituency tree-based graphs.
It verifies that:
1. Word embeddings are correctly mapped to leaf nodes
2. Special embeddings are correctly used for non-leaf nodes
3. Hierarchical relations from constituency trees are properly captured in the graph structure
